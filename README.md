# Hi, I'm Kenny 👋

**Data Analyst in training @ WBS Coding School | Finance & Banking background**

💻 I work at the intersection of **data, finance, and technology**, using Python, SQL, and BI tools to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my skills in:
- Data analysis and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Power BI/Tableau)
- Databases and SQL for reporting and dashboards
- Building analytics solutions for real-world finance and banking problems

💼 Professional background:
- Several years in **Finance and Banking**, working with customer accounts, reconciliations, and financial reporting
- Now transitioning into **data analytics** and **fintech**, focusing on data-driven decision-making

🧪 Projects & interests:
- Data analysis projects in finance, payments, and customer behavior
- Exploring trading/market data, risk, and fraud-related use cases
- Open to collaborating on analytics and fintech projects (dashboards, reporting, automation)

🌍 Languages: **English**, **German**  

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  

♟ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess – still practicing strategy, just on a different board.
